This folder contains raw data for the driving sessions. Each driving session is recorded using two Android Smartphones, using an app called "GPS logger". The app records on a one-second interval: latitude, longitude, speed, timestamp. Additionally, research notes are added, annotated with lat, lon, speed and time. Each recording results in two files: GPX-file, and a KML-file. Therefore each driving session results in four files in total.

Each datafile is named either 'Series A' or 'Series B'. Series A is the primary recording from the Android phone with the highest quality GPS reception. Series B is the backup recording of the same trip with the other Android phone. Each datafile has the timestamp of storage in its name in format: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS. Finally, each filename contains the track name and name abbreviation.

This data must never be edited directly. In case editing needs to be done, copy the data to somewhere else and edit the copy.
