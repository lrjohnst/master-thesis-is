Survey cleaning and descriptive stats
- The survey was designed and administered via a web-based application called SurveyLegend.
- Finally the data was exported to a MS Excel table.
- The survey was then made inaccessible, and no new observations were gathered.
- Of 80 responses in total, 13 were disqualified due to not owning drivers license, or not using any navigation system or incompleteness.
- The mean frequency of weekly car use among participants was 4,18 days.
- The mean time of completion for the survey was 1086 seconds.
- The first survey response was on April 29. The last response was on June 8.
- The general distractions were coded and the resulting codes were counted using a PHP-script specially developed for this purpose. To retrieve an analysis on which distractions are most top-of-mind, a salience index was calculated with the formula: ranking = (weight_column1 * count_column1) + (weight_column2 * count_column2) + (weight_column3 * count_column3) + (weight_column4 * count_column4) + (weight_column5 * count_column5).
- Coding procedure nav_distractions_1-5: The full set of open answers (fields 1 through 5) are coded by one person. Firstly a round of open coding is applied. In the second round, the first codes are refined.
- T-test requirements for Closed Nav Distractions: Independent samples: Y, Normally distributed: N, Equal variance: Y.
- With the open question of 'nav distractions' my expectation was that the responses could be classified into 'visual distraction', 'cognitive distraction', and so-on. But due to the posing of the question, the answers were unexpected. The answers were mostly complaints about the navigation system that caused distraction, for instance: traffic notifications, bad instructions.
- With the open question of 'nav behavior' the expectation was that the responses could be classified into 'SDLP', 'speed control', and so-on. The answers were for a large part as expected, but also with exceptions.
- The instances where the code on nav_behavior turned out to be 'distraction' are unfortunately not useful. The code 'distraction' by itself is not a valid way to distinguish groups, because the code does not constitute a valid answer to the question. If the sample size were larger, the codes 'distraction' could be split up into 'visual', 'cognitive', et cetera, and serve as substitute answers for 'nav_distractions'. But the sample size would then not be large enough to do meaningful statistical tests.
- Code "Decision making": specific complaint about impaired decision making. This does not include things like "I find it harder to make decisions". It includes things like "I make a wrong turn". If it's more a complaint like "hard to anticipate", the code "cognitive distraction" is used.

Coding manual

Coding nav_distractions_1-5:
- The person is not considered an actor with any initiative. This is to say: a person does not bear responsibility in receiving or interpreting the navigation system correctly. Only the navigation system itself bears responsibility for the effectiveness of the navigation tasks. Therefore, a code could never be for instance: "user fails to interpret navigation correctly". In this case the code should be more something like: "navigation system fails to communicate".
