This study aimed to analyze the hypothesized differences in driving performance between smartphone-based and car-integrated navigation systems, specifically investigating whether smartphone-based systems result in worse performance. Previous work in this field includes simulation-based and naturalistic studies aimed at discerning relations between driving performance indicators and car information systems, or more specifically their interface design and input modalities. The study was conducted in two phases: a requirements elicitation phase, including a survey and an expert interview, followed by testing in a naturalistic qualitative set-up. The study did not prove that driving performance with smartphone-based systems is lower compared to car-integrated systems. On the contrary, car-integrated navigation users reported significantly more often cases of unhelpful information and degraded decision making. Visual distraction is identified as the most important indicator regarding safety of navigation systems. Other typical distractions and driving performance measures relevant to navigation systems are unhelpful information, communication errors, conflicts with systems in the surrounding context, speed control and decision making. Streaming-based navigation systems were analysed as third type of navigation system. The study concludes by formulating hypotheses concerning differences between the three navigation system types and offers suggestions for future work, including broadening the research approach, further developing theory around this topic and deductive testing.
